# external/

Vendored dependencies, checked in so a normal clone configures and builds
without network access.

**`lexbor/` and `nanovg/` are git SUBTREES** of the maintained AffineUI forks
(`affineui_lexbor` @ `affineui`, `affineui_nanovg` @ `master`) — they are the
**canonical, in-tree, editable source**. Edit them here directly (e.g. extend
lexbor's CSS), build, and the change ships. Sync with the forks via subtree:

```bash
scripts/sync_lexbor_from_fork.sh        # git subtree pull  (fork -> here)
git subtree push --prefix=external/lexbor <fork-path> affineui   # here -> fork
# (sync_nanovg_from_fork.sh / external/nanovg, branch master, likewise)
```

`sokol/`, `stb/`, `yoga/` remain pinned snapshots (refresh = explicit step).

## Inventory

| Dir | Upstream | License | Pinned at | Used for |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| `sokol/` | https://github.com/floooh/sokol | zlib | `master @ <fetch date>` | GPU + windowing (single-header) |
| `nanovg/` | https://github.com/memononen/nanovg | zlib | `master @ <fetch date>` | Vector painter |
| `lexbor/` | local AffineUI fork of https://github.com/lexbor/lexbor | Apache-2.0 | `affineui/v2.4.0` | HTML5 parser, CSS parser, DOM, selector matching |
| `yoga/` | https://github.com/facebook/yoga | MIT | `v3.2.1` | Flexbox math |
| `stb/` | https://github.com/nothings/stb | MIT / public domain | `master @ <fetch date>` | `stb_truetype.h`, `stb_image.h` |

## Rules of engagement

1. **Snapshots vs subtrees.** `lexbor/` + `nanovg/` are subtrees — edit them
   in-tree (then `git subtree push` to the fork). `sokol/`, `stb/`, `yoga/`
   are pinned snapshots — don't edit directly; bump the pin instead.
2. **Pin versions explicitly.** Whatever is committed under `external/`
   is what we test against. Updating a pin = a PR with a CI run.
3. **License attribution.** Each library's own `LICENSE` file stays
   alongside its sources. Distribution artifacts must keep the license
   banner and any required notices.

## How it integrates

- `sokol/`, `nanovg/`, and `stb/` are header-only or near-header-only.
  NanoVG carries the fontstash/stb copies it needs under `nanovg/src/`.
  `cmake/Dependencies.cmake` adds the curated include paths; a few `.c`
  TUs under `src/paint/` and `src/text/` hold their implementation
  definitions.
- `lexbor/` is a real CMake project — we `add_subdirectory(EXCLUDE_FROM_ALL)`
  it and link `lexbor_static`.
- `yoga/` is a real CMake project — same treatment, links `yogacore`.

## Optional (not vendored by default)

| Dir | Why | When to enable |
|---|---|---|
| `harfbuzz/` | Complex-script shaping | `-DAFFINEUI_ENABLE_HARFBUZZ=ON` |
| `libunibreak/` | UAX #14 line breaking | `-DAFFINEUI_ENABLE_UNIBREAK=ON` |
