// Yoga layout adapter. The single seam between the engine's
// ComputedStyle world and Yoga's YGNode world.
//
// Why this exists as its own module:
//   • Layout is the highest-risk subsystem (cf. docs/DESIGN.md §
//     Correctness discipline). Containing every Yoga touchpoint to
//     one file keeps the blast radius small and the failure modes
//     isolated.
//   • Yoga's quirks vs CSS (defaults, margin non-collapse, abs
//     positioning) are encoded here once, documented inline, and
//     never leak past this boundary.
//   • Tests can target this adapter directly — feed in styles, read
//     out bounds, no GL or NanoVG required.
//
// Interface contract:
//   Input  : viewport width in px + a span of "block descriptors"
//            (computed style + intrinsic content size).
//   Output : a parallel span of bounds (x, y, w, h in px relative to
//            the viewport origin).
//   Side effects: none. All Yoga nodes allocated here are freed before
//   return. The adapter is stateless across calls.
